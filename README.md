# Go Doc Markdown

godoc alternative for static markdown documentation.

## Motivation

Standard for Go [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/) is awesome but not suitable for private repos. You can use [pkgsite](https://cs.opensource.google/go/x/pkgsite) as local alternative but it's not perfect. As stated in the [comment](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/2381#issuecomment-2183224009) of an engineer from Amazon sometimes it's a nightmare. You have to checkout a repo, run local server and open it in a browser only to read documentation.

With `gdmd` you don't even have to host your documentation, you can keep it in your repo along with the code. 

## Documentation
